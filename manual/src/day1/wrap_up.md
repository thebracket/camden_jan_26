# Wrap-Up Day 1

We've covered a lot today! You've built a real Rust application, complete with a library and a CLI consumer. 

You've learned about cargo, types, structs, enums, using dependencies and building your own libraries. There's still a lot to learn - but on the first day, you've made a useful program.

And... did you notice that so far, we've not mentioned memory?
