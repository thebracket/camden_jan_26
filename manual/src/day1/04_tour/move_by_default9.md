# Task: Make a function that borrows and returns

To make sure that you have this down, let's do a quick task.

1. Create a new Rust project with `cargo new (name)`.
2. In `main.rs`, create a string.
3. Pass it to a function that borrows it and prints it.
4. Print the string again in `main` to show that it's still valid.

For the second part, change the function to modify the string.
